# The_Basic_Algorithms
I'll try to add the algorithms I read to this repository. Not cool or anything. just for learning purpose. see if something interesting comes up. We will take that from there.

I am a new learner. A bit out of date but want to learn new cool things. Code seems to drive me yet most days I don't write even a single line of code. I like to and hence joined this repository. To read learn and implement and get to work and the thing drives me. 

This Algorithms project would be my first project. I'll try to implement the basic algorithms. learning and making myself familiar with repository.
